### Exercises 1.1-1
***
Give a real-world example in which one of the following computational problems appears: sorting, determining the best order for multiplying matrices, or finding the convex hull.

### `Answer`
* 用到排序的应用很多，比如电商网站对商品按价格进行排序
* The multiplication process in computers are time consuming than addition process. If we have three or more matrices to multiply, then we should check the order in which to multiply to reduce the number of multiplications.
* [From Wiki]The problem of finding convex hulls finds its practical applications in pattern recognition, image processing, statistics, geographic information system, game theory, construction of phase diagrams, and static code analysis by abstract interpretation. It also serves as a tool, a building block for a number of other computational-geometric algorithms such as the rotating calipers method for computing the width and diameter of a point set. also application in [CV](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/imgproc/shapedescriptors/hull/hull.html).


### Exercises 1.1-2
***
Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?

### `Answer`
Memory usage, resource usage (network, disk, etc.)
Memory requirement, Degree of parallelism, Resource use( cpu or gpu cycles, Disk IO etc), Accessibility(Cloud/local)


### Exercises 1.1-3
***
Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

### `Answer`
Arrays are fast to access and cannot be resized dynamically.

### Exercises 1.1-4
***
How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

### `Answer`
* Similarity: They both find a path in the picture
* Difference: The shortest path only finds the path between two points, but the traveling salesman problem requires traversing all points and returning to the starting point, which is a total permutation problem.
* In travelling salesman problem we want to know an order of delivery of stops that yields "lowest overall distance" travelled .
* This "lowest overall distance" is similar to shortest path finding situation .
* Shortest path is polynomially solvable but travelling -salesman is NP-Complete

### Exercises 1.1-5
***
Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.

### `Answer`
这题好抽象 0 0   求根如果是无理数近似就行了找不到最优的.
